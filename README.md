Bang4Buck is a service web application that takes a different approach to eating out by starting with your desired spending and working backwards to show you what you can eat at local restaurants for that price or less.

As college students, we realize that getting the most value for your dollar can go a long way in controlling your spending; helping other have more control over their dining experience is the inspiration for this project.
